                            "Dance is your pulse, your heartbeat, your breathing. It is the rhythm of your life. It's the expression in time and movement, in happiness, joy, sadness, and envy."

                            I started dancing since I was a kid. Different from other hobbies, dance is the most direct way to help me express my emotions and communicate with the world through the moves of my body. From traditional dance to jazz and to urban, there is always a window that enable you to resonate with the nature of human emotions, and let the world embrace your passion and energy.

                            Chinese dance is has been the absolte love throughout my life, not only because it's rich in emitions, but also because it represents the culture of my origin. It is such a pleasure to find a group of dancers in Cal who also cherish dance as a type of arts and culture representation.
                            Choreographed by Michelle Lin, "Snow Flurries" depicts a scene of snowflakes flying and filling the sky, expressed through the Classical Chinese dance style. The fans are a traditional prop and are classically used to symbolize floweres, and in this case, flowers of snow. Through the changes in music, various forms of snowfall are illustrated, from light flurries to blizzards.

                            It was not until I came to college that I realized my passion in comtemporary dance. Joining a urban dance team catapulted me into an entirely different but enchanting universe - one where dance could be violent and intense, chill and sassy, delightful and engaging. Different from traditional dance set's implicit expression of emotions, urban sets push through in a more vibrant and direct way.
